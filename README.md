# MFEMPLUS

*MFEMPLUS* is a set of cpp files that are extensions to the *MFEM* library. It contains two sets of cpp and hpp files. One is for custom integrators and the other for custom functions, such as computing stresses and strains. 

If you write a new integrator or function and are a contributer, you can push to this repository, ensuring that there are no push conflicts.
